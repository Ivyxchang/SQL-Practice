-- Using tables from: dvdrentals.public ---------
-------------------------------------------------

-- Take a look at the payment table.
SELECT *
FROM payment;

-- Take a look at the customer table.
SELECT *
FROM customer;


-- How does it appear that these 2 tables might
-- match up?
-- In this join which key is a primary key? which is a foreign key?
-- payment <-customer_id-> customer

-- Can you find the key information in the table
-- properties?
-- Right click on table -> Constraints -> Look at tabs

-- JOIN the payment and customer tables.
-- Only keep records found in both tables.
SELECT *
FROM payment AS p
INNER JOIN customer AS c
  ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id;

-- How many records result from this JOIN?
-- 16049
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM payment AS p
INNER JOIN customer AS c
  ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id;

-- How many records were in each of the 2 input tables?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer;  -- 599
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payment;   -- 16049

-- We are sending out a promotion via snail mail.
-- We want to avoid saying "Current resident"; instead we
-- want the full name.  Please retrieve all the pieces of info
-- for addressing the envelopes.
SELECT *
FROM customer;

SELECT *
FROM address;

-- Row count: 599
SELECT INITCAP(first_name) AS first_name,
       INITCAP(last_name) AS last_name,
	   address
FROM customer AS c
INNER JOIN address AS a
   ON c.address_id = a.address_id;

-- Repeat the above query but this time ensure that you don't
-- lose any records from either table.
-- Row count: 603
SELECT first_name,
       last_name,
	   address
FROM customer AS c
FULL JOIN address AS a
   ON c.address_id = a.address_id;

-- In this case, did changing the JOIN type make a difference?
-- How can you tell?  Row count is different
-- If there is a difference, can you write a query to isolate
-- the different records?
SELECT first_name,
       last_name,
	   address
FROM customer AS c
FULL JOIN address AS a
   ON c.address_id = a.address_id
WHERE first_name IS NULL
   OR address IS NULL;

-- Use table IS NULL to find rows
-- Courtesy of Joshua (et al 2021)
SELECT first_name,
       last_name,
	   address
FROM customer AS c
FULL JOIN address AS a
   ON c.address_id = a.address_id
WHERE c IS NULL;

-- We can keep the JOIN ðŸš‚ rolling and join on join on join on join on join on join on join on join on join...
-- We are sending out bills to our customers using snail mail.
-- We want to avoid saying "Current resident"; instead we
-- want the full name.  Please retrieve all the pieces of info
-- for addressing the envelopes and a customer's payment info.

-- customer <-customer_id-> payment
SELECT first_name,
       last_name,
	   address,
       amount AS payment_amount
FROM address AS a
INNER JOIN customer AS c
  ON a.address_id = c.address_id
INNER JOIN payment AS p
  ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id;

-- Aggregate the data from the last query to show a payment total per customer
SELECT first_name,
       last_name,
	   address,
       SUM(amount) AS total_payment_amount
FROM address AS a
INNER JOIN customer AS c
  ON a.address_id = c.address_id
INNER JOIN payment AS p
  ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id,
         first_name,
		 last_name,
		 address
ORDER BY total_payment_amount DESC;

-- We can also JOIN a table to itself

-- Don't have a great setup for why we'd want to do this
-- in our dvdrentals data...
-- but here's an example self JOIN query down below.
-- This is also a use case for aliasing where it's not
-- only an aid to readability.
SELECT a.customer_id,
       CONCAT('A - ', a.first_name) AS cust_name_a,
       CONCAT('B - ', b.first_name) AS cust_name_b
FROM customer AS a
INNER JOIN customer AS b
  ON a.customer_id = b.customer_id;


-- Example potential use case:
-- We have a 'employee' table modeled like below.
-- We could do a self join to find out who everyone's manager is.
-- |  id  |  name  |   manager  |
-- |:----:|:------:|:----------:|
-- |  1   | Skyler |     3      |
-- |  2   | Elliot |    NULL    |
-- |  3   | Peyton |     2      |

-- SELECT *
-- FROM employee AS emp
-- LEFT JOIN employee AS mgr
--   ON emp.manager = mgr.id;

-- Results:
-- |  id  |  name  | manager |  id  |  name  | manager |
-- |:----:|:------:|:-------:|:----:|:------:|:-------:|
-- |  1   | Skyler |    3    |  3   | Peyton |    2    |
-- |  2   | Elliot |   NULL  | NULL |  NULL  |   NULL  |
-- |  3   | Peyton |    2    |  2   | Elliot |   NULL  |
